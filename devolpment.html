                <h3>HTML </h3>
                <p>well, the first thing we did is that he made us make a html file and use article and explain the difference between article and section. He also told us to make something in html and show him only using html.</p>
                <p>
                    <strong>What I have learned:</strong>I’ve learned that you aren’t supposed to use the "br" element in html and, I learned what the difference is between article and section also we learned that we are supposed to re size are photos in photoshop to get the best quality as well.
                </p>
                <p>
                    <strong>How I think it went:</strong> I personally think  it went well I knew most of the things that we did in html and of course more we get into it the more I will learn.

                <h3>Keyframes in CSS  </h3>
                <p> In this assignment I had the task to make a box jump and change colour between blue green and yellow. With animation in CSS using keyframes.</p>
                <p>
                    <strong>What I have learned:</strong>In CSS learned how the animations works and how the keyframes work as well. I found it really cool how the animation works.
                </p>
                <p>
                    <strong>How I think it went:</strong> I think personally that it went well I learned until now some new stuff and understood more how keyframes work and animations. I still think I have a lot of room to improve on development and by making more project I will get better.

                <h3>Jigglypuff</h3>
                <p>had the task to make the best Jigglypuff Pokémon only using ChatGPT and see how it works. </p>
                <p>
                    <strong>What I have learned:</strong>I learned how hard it can be to get what you want from ChatGPT and that sometimes it can’t make what you would like.
                </p>
                <p>
                    <strong>How I think it went:</strong>I think personally it went well it was a great experience to how difficult it can be using chat gpt and how you should ask questions as well.

                <h3>Box colour change</h3>
                <p>the assignment was to go and play with JavaScript and see how it goes at first it was a bit hard because I didn’t t understand some stuff but afterwards, I manage to make a box that can change colour every time you press it. </p>
                <p>
                    <strong>What I have learned:</strong>Well, I learned how java script work I’m still learning but I’m enjoy it a lot and I’m doing a lot of different work on java script.

                    <strong>How I think it went:</strong>Well at first, I think I was a bit lost but after playing with it and watching different YouTube video’s I manage to build a box that changes colour.
