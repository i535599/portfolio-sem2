                <h3>Notion</h3>
                <p>My team and I decided to make a notion were we can upload everything we need for the project every information and in notion you can see the when we have to finish something witch date.</p>
                <p>
                        <strong>What I have learned:</strong>Iâ€™ve learned that you need to communicate good with your team members and know what everyone is doing I think by doing this your project will go smoother. Also having a calendar to see what we must have done by what time is verry useful as well.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        <strong>How I think it went:</strong>I feel like it went well me and my group communicated everything we finish everything on time that the notion had plant for us.

                <h3>Brand guide</h3>
                <p>I also did a brand guide where our client can see everything what we did how they could do it and what they should or should not do. It is like a follow book.
                    <p>
                        <strong>What I have learned:</strong>That doing a brand guide is verry important for a company and it is verry useful so people can follow what they should or should not do for example the logo what kind of background we use or what colour we decided to use in the thing we made etc.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        <strong>How I think it went:</strong>I think building the brand guide was went good at first we had to get some inspiration to how we should do it and after one of the teachers showed us one brand guide he did of Volkswagen we kind of got the idea on how we would like to use it.
