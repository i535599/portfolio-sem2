                <h3>Assignment 1</h3>
                <p>Assignment 1, we did a survey where we let people fill it out and give us a guide to what we should work on the project. This is all under interactive media. In the PDF you can read how it went and what I have learned, and see more pictures about the survey.</p>

                    <strong>What I have learned:</strong> Doing a survey is helpful to understand the target audience and get feedback on what we should or should not add.
