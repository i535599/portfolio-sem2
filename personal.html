                <h3> Feedback</h3>
                <p>So far I have asked for feedback of my portfolio and the ux design assignment we had the first week of the semester. I have also played with photoshop as well to understand it better.</p>

                        <strong>What I have learned:</strong>So far, I have asked for feedback of my portfolio and the ux design assignment we had the first week of the semester. I have also played with photoshop as well to understand it better.

                        <strong>How I think it went:</strong>Asking for feedback is always helpful to improve even if you sometimes don’t get the feedback, you want that a way of motivating you to work more and improve my skills
                        How I think it went:
                        I think until now it’s going good the feedback I have gotten have helped me improve my portfolio and my skills as well.

                <h3> Free Time</h3>
                <p>  In my free time I have played with photoshop and try to understand every single tool. And this is a photo of myself that I have edit it while working on understanding photoshop.</p>
                    <p>
                        <strong>What I have learned:</strong>doing project of your own to understand the new tools is a good way to practice. Also doing research about the tools helps a lot.

                    <p>
                        <strong>How I think it went:</strong>I think until now it’s going well. And practicing using photoshop has also helped me understand it more as well.
