        <h2>About Me</h2>
        <p> My name is Christopher Jhonathan Koolman,
            I am 20 years old doing media and design at Fontys.
             I like painting and going to out.
              I choose media because I enjoy making the websites, I find it fun.
               I live in Breda. I come from Aruba there I got my havo diploma.My mom is from Colombia And my dad s from Aruba.
               so I'm have spanish aswell.
               After I finished my havo I came here to do ICT at Fontys. 
               I choose Fontys because it was the one that I got the most information about
                and seemed the most interesting.In my free time I like to go to the gym and play sports and also going out and explore.
                I find it really fun going exploring different paces in europe or even in the Netherlands.
                    At Aruba I used to play a lot of sport but the sport that I did the most was volleyball I love playing it.
                    Also In my free time I enjoy doing research about how to make websties and find different designs  for a website.</p>
